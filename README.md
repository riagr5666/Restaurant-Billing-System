# Restaurant-Billing-System
In this project, I have created a prototype to Calculate bill in a restaurant
user will see date and time on first line 
1. User has to go through verification by entering username and password [username = admin, password = admin]
2. they can select/set price or generate bill directly.
3. they will see bill no. different food items which are stored and modified internally
4. after entering details they will see total price.

+++++++++++THIS IS A PROTOTYPE ONLY SO KINDLY GIVE SUGGESTION RATHER POINTING OUT MISTAKES++++++++++++++++
